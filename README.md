# BlinkIT-Dashboard

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description  
This project presents a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** built for **Blinkit**, a quick-commerce platform, focusing on visualizing and analyzing its sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution across various outlets. The goal is to extract actionable insights using interactive KPIs and charts to enable data-driven decision-making.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project  
The primary aim is to translate Blinkit's business data into clear, visual insights that highlight patterns, trends, and areas for improvementâ€”ultimately empowering stakeholders to make informed business decisions regarding sales strategy, customer engagement, and operational efficiency.

---

## ðŸ’¼ Business Problem  
Blinkit operates in a highly competitive on-demand delivery sector. With a growing volume of product offerings and customers, understanding **what sells, where, and why** is critical. Currently, insights into how factors such as **fat content**, **outlet size**, and **establishment year** impact sales are not clearly visualized. Blinkit needs an interactive dashboard that reveals:
- Sales drivers by item and outlet type  
- Inventory performance and customer satisfaction  
- Trends based on outlet characteristics and locations  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Dashboard Goals  
- Visualize **Total Sales**, **Average Revenue per Sale**, **Number of Items Sold**, and **Average Customer Rating**  
- Correlate product features like **fat content** with sales and satisfaction  
- Analyze sales across different **item types**, **outlets**, and **geographic locations**  
- Enable deep-dive analysis to identify business optimization opportunities  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Visual Walkthrough & Insights

### 1. Total Sales by Fat Content *(Donut Chart)*  
**Objective**: Understand how fat content impacts sales volume.  
**Insight**: Higher-fat items tend to generate higher total sales, indicating customer preference.

---

### 2. Total Sales by Item Type *(Bar Chart)*  
**Objective**: Identify top-performing product categories.  
**Insight**: Certain item types consistently outperform others, signaling inventory prioritization opportunities.

---

### 3. Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales *(Stacked Column Chart)*  
**Objective**: Compare how fat content variations influence sales across different outlets.  
**Insight**: Some outlets have strong performance in specific fat-content categories, suggesting regional preferences.

---

### 4. Sales by Outlet Establishment Year *(Line Chart)*  
**Objective**: Evaluate if newer or older outlets generate more sales.  
**Insight**: Outlets established within the last 3 years show higher growth trends, suggesting effective expansion strategies.

---

### 5. Sales by Outlet Size *(Donut/Pie Chart)*  
**Objective**: Determine if outlet size correlates with higher sales.  
**Insight**: Medium-sized outlets contribute the highest to total sales, balancing cost and coverage effectively.

---

### 6. Sales by Outlet Location *(Funnel Map)*  
**Objective**: Visualize sales distribution geographically.  
**Insight**: Urban locations dominate sales, but rural areas show potential for targeted marketing.

---

### 7. All Metrics by Outlet Type *(Metric Cards)*  
**Objective**: Provide a consolidated view of all KPIsâ€”Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating by outlet type.  
**Insight**: Supermarket-style outlets perform better across all KPIs compared to convenience formats.

---

## ðŸ”§ Project Workflow  
1. Business Requirement Gathering  
2. Data Walkthrough & Connection  
3. Data Cleaning & Quality Check  
4. Data Modeling  
5. DAX Calculations & Processing  
6. Dashboard Layout & Chart Development  
7. Insight Generation & Business Recommendations  

---

## ðŸ§® KPI Definitions  
- **Total Sales**: Overall revenue generated from all sold items  
- **Average Revenue per Sale**: Revenue per transaction/sale  
- **Number of Items Sold**: Total count of items sold  
- **Average Customer Rating**: Mean rating for sold products  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Tools Used  
- Power BI Desktop  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Power Query for data transformation  
- GitHub for version control and project documentation  

---

## ðŸ“Š Outcome & Business Impact  
- Highlighted product attributes that drive sales (e.g., fat content)  
- Identified top-performing outlets and item types  
- Uncovered geographic and demographic sales patterns  
- Provided actionable KPIs for sales and marketing strategy
